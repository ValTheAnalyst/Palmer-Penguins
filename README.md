# Palmer Penguins

Here, I utilize an RMarkdown format to create a comprehensive report assessing the body mass vs flipper length of 3 species of penguin.
This data comes from the Palmer Penguins library.

In this project, I originally used RStudio Cloud to take advantage of R language, and installed the tidyverse and ggplot2 packages.
